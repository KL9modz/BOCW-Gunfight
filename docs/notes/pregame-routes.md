# Pregame routes — what can reach the lobby BEFORE the match starts

klaze, 2026-09-09: *"pregame control would be the single most valuable mod for this entire project."*
This note is the research behind it: every route from our code to the pregame lobby that the dump,
the ACTS source and ate47's notes support, what each has going for it, and the one test that decides
the cheapest of them. **Nothing here is measured in-game unless the line says so.**

▶ **The headline: GSC runs in the pregame lobby, and the lobby keeps a live gametype-setting store
that script can read.** Both were recorded as false in three files. The test is built:
[`../../src/test_frontend/`](../../src/test_frontend/), read-only by default, offline checks green,
never compiled or injected.

## The claim this retracts

`roadmap.md` A2 opened with *"Nothing GSC runs in the pregame lobby."* `lobby-settings.md` said
*"`frontend.gsc` is NOT the lobby … do not go looking for the lobby in GSC."* `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
carried the same line. All three rested on one reading of `frontend.gsc` — a 618-line file whose
retail portion is **108 lines**; everything from `:110` down is one `/# … #/` dev block. What the
retail part does:

| `frontend.gsc` | What it is |
|---|---|
| `:35` `event_handler[gametype_init] main()` | the frontend map's gametype handler — a **server-side** script running in the front end |
| `:46` `gamestate::set_state( #"pregame" )` | it sets **the pregame state**. `gamestate.gsc:31` → `game.state = #"pregame"; level notify( #"pregame" )` |
| `:49` `callback::add_callback( #"menu_response", … )` | a LUI → GSC channel, live in the lobby (`callbacks_shared.gsc:2054` queues it from `event_handler[ui_menuresponse]`) |
| `:37-41` `level.callbackplayerconnect = …` | players **connect** in the frontend — the local player is an entity there |

"Not the lobby" was right about one thing: **map, mode, rules and invites are not written in GSC.**
Those live in compiled LUA and the session layer. But *"nothing GSC runs there"* was wrong, and the
question that matters — can script **read and write the lobby's gametype settings** — was never asked.

## The evidence, split by where it comes from

⚠ ate47's `t8-atian-menu/docs/notes/loaded/` is a **BO4 capture**, not Cold War: 28 of the 216
scripts it names (`tabun.gsc`, `platoons.gsc`, `shoutcaster.csc`, the `ai/planner_commander*` set)
do not exist in the CW dump. It is same-lineage evidence with numbers, and it is quoted here as
exactly that. The Cold War-native evidence stands on its own.

### Cold War (primary dump, `ate47/bocw-source`)

- **Eleven stock GSC files guard on `util::is_frontend_map()`** (`util_shared.gsc:5889`,
  `return get_map_name() === "core_frontend"`). Two of the guards sit in **system preinits** —
  `bot.gsc:39`, `player_shared.gsc:29` — and the rest in `spawning_shared.gsc:36`,
  `scene_shared.gsc:129`, `death_circle.gsc:42`, `dynent_use.gsc:24`, `item_world_util.gsc:356`,
  `player_shared.gsc:131`, `spawning_squad.gsc:1267`, `bot_devgui.gsc:27`, `mp_common/player/player.gsc:160`.
  **Stock does not guard against a VM it never runs in.** So `core_common` — callbacks, system, util —
  links and its preinits execute in the frontend server VM.
- **ACTS documents the hook.** `t8-atian-menu/coldwar/gsc.conf`: *"Recommended injection points: MP:
  `scripts\mp_common\bb.gsc` · ZM: `scripts\zm_common\load.gsc` · Frontend:
  `scripts\core_common\load_shared.gsc`"* — and `load_shared.gsc:63` `preinit()` branches on
  `sessionmodeiscampaigngame()` / `…zombiesgame()` / else, with **no MP gate**: it is the one script
  written to run in every VM.
- **The frontend re-links from the pool on every return.** That is what the `scene_model_shared`
  hang measured (`menu-map.md`): a replaced buffer that the frontend needed at link time hung
  "connecting to lobby". Same mechanism, this time on purpose.
- **`frontend.csc:2918-2920` reads gametype settings from inside the lobby:**
  ```
  if ( level.lastlobbystate === #"matchmaking" || … === #"lobby_pose" ) {
      …
      if ( is_true( getgametypesetting( #"hash_5462586bdce0346e" ) ) )
          var_ca8c236b = min( getgametypesetting( #"hash_3a4691a853585241" ), var_68a9a63c.size );
  ```
  `hash_3a4691a853585241` is **`maxsquadplayers`** (cracked, validated in-game by L5). The client
  script caps the lobby's character line-up by a *gametype setting of the pending game*, on
  `#"lobby_change"`, in `lobby_pose`. **So the engine keeps a gametype-setting store while the
  lobby is being configured, and script can read it.** ⚠ That is the CSC (client) VM. The GSC
  builtin has the same name and the same 1-arg form; whether the server VM's store is the same
  object is untested — that is probe 52.
- **`getgametypesetting` has GSC frontend precedent only behind a guard.** `bot.gsc:39-49`:
  `if ( util::is_frontend_map() ) return;` … `getgametypesetting( #"hash_77b7734750cd75e9" )`. Either
  the call throws in the frontend or its answer is meaningless there; the guard cannot say which.
  Probe 50 (tick count stashed before the read) separates the two.

### BO4 (ate47's capture — same lineage, not the same game)

`loaded/link_frontend.txt`: **`instance SERVER(0) : 190 loaded script(s)`** in the frontend, among
them `callbacks_shared` (refCount 63), `system_shared` (80), `util_shared` (86), `array_shared`,
`gamestate`, `bots/bot.gsc` (11), **`load_shared.gsc`** (`:172`, refCount 2) and
**`clientids_shared.gsc`** (`:171`, refCount 1) — the hook *and* the replace target, in the pool at
the main menu. `bb.gsc` and the rest of `mp_common` are absent from the server instance. And
`scripts/core/frontend.gsc` — BO4's `frontend_exec_delay()`, kept in ate47's own menu source and
**left disabled**, iterates `getplayers()` for `ishost()` in the frontend: the injected script ran
there, the local player was an entity, and he stopped at `wait 10` with the interesting lines
commented out. Precedent for *running*; none for *controlling*.

---

## Routes

### P1 · A frontend GSC payload ← **built: `src/test_frontend/`**

Hook `load_shared.gsc` instead of `bb.gsc`; same replace target. The payload links in **every** VM,
and `util::is_frontend_map()` — the check stock itself uses — decides which half runs.

| | |
|---|---|
| Inject | at the **main menu**, no match needed first (⚠ predicted from BO4's `pool_frontend.txt`; `inject.sh` says what to record if CW differs) |
| Goes live | MP half on the next match; **frontend half on the next return to the lobby after a match** |
| `#using` | **core_common only.** `mp_common` is not loaded in the frontend and pulling it in from there is an untested link. `gunfight_menu` `#using`s `mp_common\gametypes\gunfight` and `bots\bot` — it **cannot** simply be re-hooked |
| Output | **dvars.** Nothing is known to render in the lobby; `iprintlnbold` is tried and expected to show nothing. Each reading is stashed as `gf_fe_<id>` and printed by the in-match half of the same payload — dvars survive the transition (B4 proved they survive `map_restart`) |
| Input | none yet. `usebuttonpressed` & co. on the frontend player are untested; BO4's disabled `frontend_exec_delay` is the only precedent and it reads no buttons |
| Trigger | `level thread` from the system preinit (stock does the same, `load_shared.gsc:71-77`). **Not** `callback::on_start_gametype` — its three dispatch sites are cp/mp/zm `globallogic`, none of which exist in the frontend |

**What the read-only run answers** (probe ids in the file header): whether the frontend half runs at
all (50); the session flags there (51); `com_maxclients` seen from the lobby (58); the lobby client
count builtin (55); **`maxplayers` / `timelimit` / `maxsquadplayers` as the lobby sees them** (52–54)
— reading **6 / 40 / 0** in a 3v3 lobby, the same numbers L5–L7 measured in-match, says the frontend
store *is* the pending lobby config; whether the timer row's value shows up live in 53 says whether
the store follows the menu as it is edited.

### P2 · `setgametypesetting()` from the lobby — the write phase of the same payload

`write_maxplayers = 1` writes `maxplayers = 8` on every 10s sample and reads it back (59). Three
readouts, none of which needs a probe:

1. **the rules menu** — with `write_timelimit = 1` instead, the timer row is a visible mirror of the
   store: if it shows 60 without being touched, the write reached what the UI reads;
2. **the lobby** — can a 4th bot or player be placed on a side? klaze's lobby walk says a 3v3 lobby
   refuses the 4th today. If that refusal follows `maxplayers` the way the in-match cap did (L6), it
   lifts here, and **the stock join path seats a 4v4 with no late-join hack at all**;
3. **the match** — probe 60 reads `maxplayers` before anything in-match writes it. **8 = it
   carried.**

⚠ Hypothesis, stated as one: the per-team cap at connect is `getassignedteamname()` (engine,
`player_connect.gsc:433`), and the lobby's cap is the same session's. Both *should* read the same
`maxplayers`. "Should" is what P2 measures.

⚠ Both switches default to 0, one at a time, and the write repeats per sample because the store may be
rebuilt when the mode is picked or the lobby created — a single early write would just be overwritten.
That repetition is itself untested behaviour. Lobby return after each run.

### P3 · `adddebugcommand()` — the console from script, if it is alive

`adddebugcommand( 1 arg )` and `canadddebugcommand()` are in the CW function table
(`BlackOpsColdWar.exe+3c60330` / `+3c60340`). All **409** stock call sites are inside `/# #/` blocks.
ate47's BO4 table annotates the BO4 pair **"nulled; cbuff('$command')"** and **"return false"** and
flags them `dev`; **the CW rows carry no annotation and are NOT dev-flagged** (type `0`, where CW's
110 dev-flagged builtins — `print`, `recordline`, `box` — are `1`). Three readings of that: he never
checked CW; CW differs; the flag means something else. **One test settles it**, `debugcmd = 1` in
`test_frontend`: `adddebugcommand( "set gf_fe_dbg 7\n" )` then read the dvar (62). `set` is on the
resolved T8 command list; a private dvar is the only thing it can change.

▶ **If 62 reads 2 or 3, the console is reachable from GSC** — in the match *and* in the lobby — and
every command-shaped route below collapses into one script line: `gametype_setting`, `map`,
`lobbylaunchgame` without cwpatch, without the DLL slot, without `dcfuncscw`. If it reads 4, CW is
nulled like BO4, which is what the BO4 note predicts. Either is a measurement.

### P4 · Console commands from the DLL slot — the existing route, currently blocked

[`lobby-map-dll.md`](lobby-map-dll.md). The mechanism is proven (cwpatch overwrites the command blob
and calls the dispatcher from `discord_game_sdk.dll`); the command *list* is not: **D10 ran on
2026-09-08 and `acts dcfuncscw` returned a header and zero rows** — ACTS's hardcoded
`cmd_function_t` base is stale for this build. `tools/crack-cmds.py` is now seeded with all 449
resolved BO4 console names (`gametype_setting`, `gametype`, `map`, `customgames_save/load/count`,
`lobbyrunplaylistsettings`, `lobby_reload`, `lobbylaunchgame`, `sendinvite`,
`joinplayersessionbyxuid`) so the moment a table exists, the cracker has the right vocabulary. Until
then the route needs runtime RE against an encrypted exe. P3 is the cheap way around it.

### P5 · Saved custom-game presets on disk

BO4 has console commands `customgames_save` / `customgames_load` / `customgames_count`, and CW ships
`ddl/custom_games.ddl` (11 structs) plus `ddl/fileshare_customgame.ddl`. Local player data lives in
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War\player`. ⚠ Web reporting says settings other
than graphics and campaign saves sync to the Activision account, so a preset may be cloud-authoritative
and a local edit may be overwritten — or rejected. **Cheapest check, no code:** save a preset from the
UI, diff the player folder. Untried.

### P6 · The LUI channel

`luinotifyevent` (GSC → LUI, `frontend.gsc:536-540` uses it in dev) and `menu_response` (LUI → GSC,
retail, `frontend.gsc:49`) are both live in the lobby. Without LUA we can only fire events stock LUI
already listens for and only receive what stock LUI already sends. Useful as a *display* channel for
P1 if a lobby-visible event with a payload exists; not a control route on its own. Untried.

## Builtins with no stock caller that belong to this layer

| Builtin | Table | BO4 annotation | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enablelobbyjoins( bool )` | GSC `+3c6b150` | — | **a write.** Not in the probe. What it closes or opens is unknown |
| `getlobbyclientcount()` | GSC `+3c6b110` | *"client count + join count"* | probe 55 |
| `getlobbyuiscreen()` | GSC `+3d197a0` | *"get lobby ui screen"* | probe 57; return type unknown, `isint()`-guarded |
| `islobbybot()` | GSC method `+3c5b540` | — | per-entity; `bot::add_bot()` territory |
| `function_5f72e972( #"lobby_root" / #"lobby_clients" )` | CSC, **defined nowhere** | — | engine accessor for the lobby UI-model roots; `lobby_clients` has per-slot `entNum` / `visible` children (`frontend.csc:2588-2610`) |
| `function_77ccb73( 1 )`, `function_664bca26( lc, 1, 0 )` | CSC, defined nowhere | — | return xuid arrays the lobby line-up is built from (`frontend.csc:2909-2920`) — the roster, readable client-side |

`sessionmodeisprivate()` / `sessionmodeisprivateonlinegame()` / `sessionmodeisonlinegame()` are the
predicates a lobby payload gates on; probe 51 reads three of them.

## What this would change, if P2 lands

Every team-size route so far acts **after** the session has seated people — `maxplayers` in-match
(L6), late-join seating (C10/C11), the menu's move-player (A1). All of them fight
`getassignedteamname()`'s verdict at connect. A write that lands **before** anyone connects makes
that verdict come out right on its own, for humans, through the stock path, with nothing to undo at
the round boundary. That is why this is A2 and why it outranks polishing A1.

## Untried — not ruled out

- Whether `load_shared.gsc` / `clientids_shared.gsc` are in the CW pool at the main menu (BO4 says
  yes; `inject.sh` records the answer either way)
- Whether the frontend half's `iprintlnbold` renders anything in the lobby at all
- Button builtins on the frontend player — the input half of a lobby menu
- Whether `setgametypesetting` in the frontend touches the lobby *UI* (the rules row), the *launch*
  (probe 60), both, or neither — four outcomes, and each is informative
- `enablelobbyjoins( 0 )` as a "lock the lobby" control
- Writing `lobby_root.transitionMapIdOverride` from the frontend before `lobbylaunchgame` — the
  campaign writes it before its own map switch (`cp_common/load.gsc:398`); the lobby's launch may
  read the same field
- A `luinotifyevent` with a lobby-visible payload as P1's display channel
- P5's on-disk preset, and whether the cloud overwrites it
- The `menu_response` callback in the lobby: which stock menus send one, with what `response` /
  `intpayload` — a free input channel if any lobby button reaches it
- `hash_5462586bdce0346e`, the flag gating the `maxsquadplayers` read at `frontend.csc:2918` —
  uncracked; a squad-lobby feature switch by context
